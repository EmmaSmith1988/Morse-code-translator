# Morse Code translator
--------------

This is my morse code translator, coded using HTML, SCSS and Javascript during a morning session of week 2 of my Nology course. It has a working test file app.test.js and was written with a TDD approach, as I wrote all the test first and then wrote the functions to pass the tests.

## Capabilities
-------------

This translator is capable of taking input up to any length (although the size of the input box is enough for 40 characters) and converting it into morse code, it is case insensitive which is a feature I added so that the user can type in proper sentences and it will convert to lower case before translating. It can also translate all numbers and most punctuation found on a standard QWERTY keyboard.

## Limitations
-------------

The translator does not reverse the translation from morse code into English.

## This project contains the following files:
------------
- app.js
- app.test.js
- translator.js
- data.js
- main.scss
- index.html
- README.md
- various JSON settings file and Node modules which are untracked in Git
